The Scotch Game is an opening for white. The opening got its name from a correspondence match played in 1824 between Edinburgh (Scotland) and London.

## Scotch Game Basic Theory

In the Scotch Game, white’s first objective is to open up the centre by forcing black to exchange their e-pawn for white’s d-pawn. This will ensure that white obtains a space advantage in the centre. Then, white will put black under pressure by developing quickly and using the open lines to create attacking opportunities.

A popular variation in the Scoth Game is the Classical Variation.

The Classical Variation of the Scotch Game is a popular approach for black. By playing 4.Bc5, black develops a piece with tempo, threatening to capture the white knight on d4. If white plays 5.Nxc6, then 5…Qf6 (not 5… dxc6? 6.Qxd8+). After 5… Qf6, black is threatening 6… Qxf2# as well as 6… dxc6 and black is doing just fine.

## The Pros and Cons of the Scotch Game

By choosing to play the Scotch Game, white will almost certainly enjoy a space-advantage in the centre. However, if black defends well, white may find it difficult to maintain pressure and black may even counter-attack on the semi-open e-file.
