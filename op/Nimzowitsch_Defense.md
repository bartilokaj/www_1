The Nimzowitsch Defense is another hypermodern opening for black, also named after Aron Nimzowitsch.

## Nimzowitsch Defense Basic Theory

The Nimzowitsch Defense invites white to play 2.d4 in classical style. Black will then prepare to undermine white’s centre, striking back with either 2… e5 or 2… d5.

A popular variation in the Nimzowitsch Defense is the Scandinavian Variation.

2… d5 is referred to as the Scandinavian Defense variation of Nimzowitsch Defense because it somewhat represents a delayed version of the Scandinavian Defense (1.e4 d5).

## The Pros and Cons of the Nimzowitsch Defense

The Nimzowitsch Defense is a very practical opening, particularly at lower levels where black can surprise their opponent with it. However, experienced players will know how to get an advantage against the Nimzowitsch Defense.
