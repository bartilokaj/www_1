The Four Knights Game is an opening for black, named after the simple fact that the four knights are the first pieces to be developed in the game.

## Four Knights Game Basic Theory

Four Knights Game is a very principled opening, featuring very natural development from both sides. Both players develop their knights before the bishops. This is a little more flexible because, whereas the knights generally go to the c-and-f-files, it is a little less obvious where the bishops will go.

A popular variation in the Four Knights Game is the Double Spanish Variation (also known as the Symmetrical Variation).

Black hopes to get easy equality by keeping the position completely symmetrical.

## The Pros and Cons of the Four-Knights Game

The Four-Knights Game is a perfectly sound opening that features very natural development. However, some players may not like its simplicity. Also, due to it being very symmetrical, it may lead to rather drawish positions.
