The King’s Gambit is an opening for white, named after the early pawn-sacrifice offered on the king-side of the board.

## King’s Gambit Basic Theory

In the King’s Gambit white sacrifices a pawn, but also compromises the safety of their king, in exchange for rapid development and attacking opportunities on black’s king.

A popular variation in the King’s Gambit is the King’s Gambit Accepted.

If black accepts the pawn (the King’s Gambit Accepted), white usually responds with 3.Nf3–to prevent the immediate threat, Qh4+. White gets a stronger centre and quick development, at the cost of a pawn and compromised king-safety. The logical strategy for white is to attack quickly, before black manages to coordinate their defenses. Black, on the other hand, will seek to defend tenaciously whilst looking for an opportunity to launch a counter-attack on white’s king.

Another popular option for black is to decline the gambit and instead play 2… d5 (the Falkbeer counter-gambit).

## The Pros and Cons of the King’s Gambit

The King’s Gambit is a very exciting opening, particularly among spectators of the game! Although it’s a fun opening, white takes on a lot of risk by exposing their king. And since the opening has been studied extensively, there are many known ways for black to deal with the King’s Gambit.

The King’s Indian Attack, also known as the Barcza System (named after Gedeon Barcza), is a chess opening system for white that mirrors the popular King’s Indian Defense (from black’s side of the board).

## King’s Indian Attack Basic Theory

The King’s Indian Attack is often characterized by an all out attack on black’s king-side.

However, before they can attack, white typically aims to:

However, white should be flexible too. Depending how black plays, white may decide to rather focus on the center or expand on the queen-side.

A popular variation in the King’s Indian Attack is the Yugoslav Variation.

The Yugoslav Variation is characterized by black’s move 4… Bg4. By attacking (and potentially pinning) the knight on f3, black anticipates that white typically wants to use the e5-square as a base to attack from.

Note: When the word “Attack” appears in the name of an opening, it usually refers to an opening from white’s point of view. For example, The King’s-Indian Attack resembles the same setup for white as the King’s-Indian Defense does for black.

## The Pros and Cons of the King’s-Indian Attack

The King’s Indian Attack is fairly easy to learn because it is not very theoretical. White can often launch a promising king-side attack. However, since white doesn’t challenge the centre early on, there are many ways for black to get a decent position.

The King’s Indian Defense is an opening for black that mirrors the King’s-Indian Attack for white. The family of Indian Openings are named after the opening moves used by Moheschunder Bannerjee, a strong Indian chess player, in the late 19th century.

## King’s Indian Defense Basic Theory

The King’s Indian Defense follow hypermodern principles. That is, black allows White to build a strong pawn center to later counter-attack it with a pawn-push, either e5 or c5. Black will support the pawn-push with their minor pieces, prominently the fianchettoed bishop on g7.

A popular variation in the King’s Indian Defense is the Classical Variation.

The Classical Variation of the King’s Indian Defense refers to the classical approach from white. That is, to occupy the centre with their pawns.  White will generally aim to create a breakthrough on the queenside–with the pawn push c5. Black should try to block this pawn-advance by placing a knight on c5. If black manages to restrain white’s ideas on the queen-side, they can launch a promising attack on the white king.

## The Pros and Cons of the King’s-Indian Defense

The King’s-Indian Defense is a very dynamic opening for black and it leads to interesting positions. Even though black can often attack on the king-side, white usually has a space-advantage in the centre and it can be difficult for black to deal with pressure on the queen-side.
