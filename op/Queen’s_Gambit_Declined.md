In the Queen’s Gambit Declined Semi-Slav Variation, black intends to capture the white pawn on c4–and hold on to it by supporting it with b5 on the next move. This idea can be quite effective and white will usually try to save the pawn, Ie. by playing e3.

## The Pros and Cons of the Queen’s Gambit

Whereas Queen’s Pawn openings are generally known to be slower than King’s Pawn openings, the Queen’s Gambit picks up the speed and fights for the centre right away. Even though there are many solid responses that black can choose from, this opening is very popular on all levels of play.
