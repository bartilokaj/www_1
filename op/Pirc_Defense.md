The Pirc Defense (pronounced peerts) is an opening for black, named after the Slovenian grandmaster Vasja Pirc.

## Pirc Defense Basic Theory

The Pirc Defense is another example of hypermodern defense, meaning that black allows white to occupy the centre with their pawns. Black’s strategy will then be to attack white’s center with their minor pieces and to prepare the right moment for counter-strike in the centre. As a consequence of playing d6, black’s dark-square bishop must fianchetto to the g7-square in order to develop.

A popular variation in the Pirc Defense is the Classical Variation.

The Classical Variation of the Pirc Defense refers to the way white chooses to deal with black’s opening.  White doesn’t get too ambitious and instead of being provoked into grabbing more territory than they can defend, white simply occupies the centre with their d- and e- pawns and develops their minor pieces naturally. This approach is a logical way to deal with hypermodern theory.

## The Pros and Cons of the Pirc Defense

The Pirc Defense provokes white to be over-ambitious in the opening. If black succeeds in this, they will have good counter-attacking opportunities. However, if white isn’t provoked easily, there are many effective ways to play against the Pirc.
