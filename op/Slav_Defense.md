The Slav Defense is an opening for black that got its name thanks to a number of Slavic chess masters who helped develop the theory of this opening.

## Slav Defense Basic Theory

The theory of the Slav Defense was developed by top players who longed for a solid opening against one of white’s most popular openings, the Queen’s Gambit. One problem they had to solve, was the fact that many other defenses rely on an early e7-e6, resulting in a bad light-squared bishop (stuck behind the e6-pawn). In the main lines of the Slav Defense, black overcomes this problem by supporting the d5-pawn with their c-pawn, instead of the e-pawn, making it possible for the light-square bishop to develop freely.

A popular variation in the Slav Defense is the Semi-Slav.

Variations where black plays c7-c6 and then e7-e6, before developing the light-square bishop, is known as the Semi-Slav Defense. The Semi-Slav is actually a complex opening that combines ideas from the Queen’s Gambit Declined with that of the Slav Defense.

## The Pros and Cons of the Slav Defense

The Slav Defense was partly designed to solve the problem black often has with the locked-in light-square bishop. However, the solution creates a new problem–black’s knight on b8 is deprived of its natural development square and black’s overall development will be slower. Even so, black’s pawn-structure has no weaknesses and the Slav Defense is known for being a very solid opening for black.
