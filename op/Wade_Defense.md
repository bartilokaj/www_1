The Wade Defense is an opening for black, named after the British International Master Bob Wade, who often played this opening during his chess career. Modern Grandmasters Peter Svidler and Micheal Adams also played this opening on more than just a few occasions.

## Wade Defense Basic Theory

Right from the word go, black’s light-square bishop exerts some annoying influence on white’s knight. This implies that black may have in mind to fight for the d4- and e5-squares.

A popular variation in the Wade Defense is the Main Line.

The fact that black plays 3… Nd7 is more evidence that they want to counter-strike in the centre with e7-e5 (the Wade Defense Main Line).

## The Pros and Cons of the Wade Defense

Even though The Wade Defense opening is played surprisingly often, there is very little known theory on it. Modern computer engines (and database statistics) suggest that either 3.e4, 3.c4 or 3.Nc3 should be good for white.

There are over 9 million possible positions after only 3 moves by either side. The vast majority of these moves will of course be nonsensical. In fact, only a small percentage of all chess openings are officially named (and even then, not all of them are actually good). The Oxford Companion to Chess recognized 1327 named openings and variations. Over time this number will grow as chess players experiment with new variations.

Keep in mind that the different chess openings all strive to achieve the primary objectives of the opening–to control the centre, to develop the pieces, to get the king safe and to achieve a playable middle-game position. Over time, chess players devised unique plans to achieve these objectives–which led to the rise of many openings.

That is why many chess players opt to develop their own opening repertoire by studying a limited set of chess openings.
